# Contribution guide

We would love to receive feedbacks and contributions from the community! There are a couple of ways right now that you can contribute to this document:

* Via Github: You can find all contents in this Gitbook [here](https://github.com/citizendev-io/bubble-convention). You can create issues or create pull requests to contribute!
* Via email: This is not a recommended approach, since we'd like everything to be transparent and discussable by the community, however, if you are an organization wanting to cooperate to create a lot of contents and get recognized for instance, please feel free to reach out to [vu.tran@citizendev.io](mailto:vu.tran@citizendev.io).

In the near future, we will provide a dashboard where you can track all changes, receive notifications and submit changes without having to use Github, especially for non-developer folks without experience with Github.&#x20;
