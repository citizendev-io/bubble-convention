# Visual elements

Visual elements are simple to name. Bubble has already done a great job at automatically naming text elements, for instance.

It is recommended to simply express the semantic meaning of the element as followed:

* Non-dynamic elements: You should keep the element type first, and then its name, like usual: **`{Element type} {Name}`**. For instance: **`Button Submit Feedback`**_._
* Dynamic elements: Use **`{Element type} {Data field}`** or **`{Element type} {Operations}`**. For instance: **`Text username`** or **`Text firstName + lastName`**_._
