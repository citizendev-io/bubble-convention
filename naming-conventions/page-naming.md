# Page naming

In short, page names should be in **kebab-case** since this is the common representation in all websites. However, **reset\_pw** is an unalterable page name of Bubble, so it is not a subject of this document.

In order to differentiate regular customer-facing pages from system/non-public pages, you can use **snake\_case** for those.

In **Element naming/Reusable elements** page, we cover a specific case of using reusable elements as sub-pages in a section with single-page behavior (single-page app, tabbed contents, etc). In this case, we pass the sub pages names (usually from an option set) to the URL, hence the need of names to be **kebab-case** as well, for them to be alike.
