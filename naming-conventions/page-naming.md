# Page naming

In short, page names should be in **kebab-case** since this is the common representation in all websites. However, **reset\_pw** is an unalterable page name of Bubble, so it is not a subject of this document.

In order to differentiate regular customer-facing pages from system/non-public pages, you can use **snake\_case** for those.
